==== LVIV RP HUD - INTEGRATION GUIDE ====

This document explains how to integrate the Lviv RP HUD with your SA-MP server.

1. INSTALLATION

   a. Copy all HUD files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) to a folder accessible by your CEF plugin
      Example: /scriptfiles/cef/lviv_hud/

   b. Add lviv_hud_controller.pwn to your gamemode's /pawno/include/ directory

   c. Include the file in your gamemode:
      #include <lviv_hud_controller>

   d. Modify lviv_hud_controller.pwn to match your CEF plugin:
      - Uncomment the correct #include for your CEF plugin
      - Modify the browser creation function to match your plugin
      - Set the correct HUD_URL path

2. CUSTOMIZING THE HUD

   a. You can modify styles.css to change colors, sizes, and positions
   
   b. To add custom elements, edit index.html and update script.js accordingly

3. DEBUGGING

   a. Enable DEBUG mode in script.js to see console messages
   
   b. Test in a browser first by opening index.html directly
   
   c. If the HUD doesn't appear in-game:
      - Check your CEF plugin is working with other pages
      - Verify the file path in HUD_URL is correct
      - Check browser console for JavaScript errors

4. COMPATIBILITY

   The HUD works with most CEF plugins including:
   - CEFOF
   - SAMPSON
   - SAMP-CEF

5. FUNCTIONS YOU CAN USE FROM YOUR GAMEMODE

   SendHUDNotification(playerid, const message[], const type[] = "info")
   - Sends a notification to the player's HUD
   - Types: "info", "money", "success", "warning", "error"

6. CUSTOM DATA

   If you want to show custom data on the HUD (e.g., hunger):
   - Create your own data storage and getter functions
   - Modify the UpdatePlayerHUD function to include this data
   - Update the JSON format to include your custom fields

7. TROUBLESHOOTING

   - If default HUD elements are still visible, check the DisableDefaultHUD function
     and make sure it's being called correctly.
   
   - If data isn't updating, verify that UpdatePlayerHUD is being called regularly
     and your hooks are set up correctly.
   
   - For browser-specific issues, check the browser console in development mode.
